# Cultist Dihh Reveal ðŸŒ½

A custom Discord embed that shows "Dihh reveal - cultist" with a corn image and redirects to a rickroll.

## Usage

Share this link in Discord: https://damir1401-blip.github.io/cultist-dihh-reveal/

The embed will show:
- Title: "Dihh reveal - cultist"
- Description: "The secrets have been revealed... ðŸŒ½"
- Image: corn.png
- Auto-redirects to rickroll after 2 seconds

## Files

- `index.html` - Main HTML file with Open Graph meta tags for Discord embed
- `corn.png` - The corn image displayed in the embed
- `README.md` - This file

## How it works

1. Discord crawls the link and reads the Open Graph meta tags
2. Creates a custom embed with the specified title, description, and image
3. When users click the link, they see a themed page for 2 seconds
4. Then automatically redirects to the rickroll link

Perfect for pranks! ðŸŒ½
